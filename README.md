## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js & npm installed - [install with nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installing-and-updating)
- OpenAI API key with access to GPT-4 and DALL-E 3

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone <YOUR_REPO_URL>
   cd flamslides
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

3. Create a `.env` file in the root directory:
   ```sh
   VITE_OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
   ```

4. Start the development server:
   ```sh
   npm run dev
   ```

## üéØ Usage

1. Enter your presentation topic and provide a brief description
2. Choose the number of slides and presentation duration
3. Select your preferred style (professional, casual, or academic)
4. Click "Generate Slides" to create your presentation with:
   - GPT-4 generated content
   - DALL-E 3 generated images
   - Professional styling and layout
5. Use the chat interface to refine individual slides
6. Navigate through your presentation using the controls

## üîí Environment Variables

There are two ways to provide your OpenAI API key:

1. **Development/Self-hosted**: Using `.env` file
   ```env
   VITE_OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
   ```

2. **Browser Storage** (Recommended for users):
   - Enter your API key directly in the application
   - Key is stored securely in your browser's localStorage
   - ‚ö†Ô∏è Note: We never store or transmit your API key to any server
   - Key is only used for direct communication between your browser and OpenAI

### Security Notes
- Your API key is stored locally on your device only
- Uses browser's localStorage with encryption
- Direct browser-to-OpenAI communication
- No server storage or transmission of keys
- Clear browser data to remove stored key

### API Key Management
```typescript
// Example implementation
const storeApiKey = (key: string) => {
  // Encrypt before storing
  const encryptedKey = encryptKey(key);
  localStorage.setItem('openai_api_key', encryptedKey);
};

const getApiKey = () => {
  const encryptedKey = localStorage.getItem('openai_api_key');
  return encryptedKey ? decryptKey(encryptedKey) : null;
};
```

## üöÄ Future Improvements

### API Key Management Enhancement
- Add end-to-end encryption for API key storage
- Implement secure key rotation
- Add option to use temporary keys
- Provide usage analytics and limits

### Server-Side Storage Enhancement
Currently, presentations are stored in the browser's localStorage, which has limitations:
- Data is only accessible on the device that created it
- Storage size is limited
- No sharing capabilities across devices

Planned improvements:
```typescript
// Future Implementation
const generatePresentationId = async () => {
  const presentationData = {
    timestamp: Date.now(),
    slides: slides.map(slide => ({
      title: slide.title,
      body: slide.body,
      notes: slide.notes,
      imageUrl: slide.imageUrl,
      ai_image_description: slide.ai_image_description
    }))
  };

  // Store presentation in database
  const response = await fetch('/api/presentations', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
    body: JSON.stringify(presentationData)
  });

  return response.json();
};
```

Benefits of server-side storage:
- **Cross-device Access**: Access presentations from any device
- **Improved Sharing**: Share presentations via URLs and QR codes
- **Persistent Storage**: Data remains available after browser clear
- **Better Security**: Implement proper authentication and authorization
- **Collaboration Features**: Enable real-time collaboration (future)
